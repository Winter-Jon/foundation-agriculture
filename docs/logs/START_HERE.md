# Research Log Start Here

## Current focus

Complete the **standard milestone** without weakening trajectory, evidence, language, Blind/Oracle, answer-contract, image-isolation, or evaluation-isolation gates. The canonical method and decision table are in [RAG SFT Data Refactor Plan](../plan/rag_sft_refactor.md).

## Verified state

- Final success criterion: a separately approved forced-retrieval-off Milvus evaluation on 618 rows, above checkpoint-165's 65.21% without unacceptable subgroup regression. It has **not** been reached.
- The active scope is Stage A only: an immutable 32 strict `standard` RAG + 32 current-contract Direct corpus, then a separately approved checkpoint-165 SFT and complete forced-off phase evaluation. RAG is stratified across eight Open/Option × English/Chinese × disease/pest cells, with exactly four accepted rows per cell; collection stops per cell at four.
- Current strict view: 20 RAG total, 18/32 Stage-A quota usable; Direct is 32/32 valid. Stage A needs 14 Blind standard rows.
- Terra is suspended from future sampling: it passed API3 real-image preflight but failed two Blind `stop_correction` Pilots and one Stage-A `standard` Option Pilot after budget finalization. Use `gpt-5.6-luna` only through a new-ID strict preflight and bounded Pilot; historical unknown Luna requests remain non-replayable.
- Unknown delivery is fail-closed. Rounds 116, 117 shard 1, and 120 shard 2 must not be replayed; partial evidence is non-trainable.
- Training, immutable freeze promotion, and formal evaluation are unauthorized. No sampling, SFT, or evaluation process is running.

## Stable evidence

- State and strict gate: `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/state.json`, `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/reviews/strict_candidate_view_v1_gate.json`
- Stage-A targets and approval report: `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/approval/rag_expansion_plan_v1/standard_targets.jsonl`, `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/approval/rag_expansion_plan_v1/report.json`
- Terra negative evidence: `outputs/runs/rag/rag-sft-round121-terra-preflight/logs/preflight_report.json`, `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/candidates/round122-terra-shard3-pilot/pilot/`, `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/candidates/round123-terra-finalization-repair-pilot/pilot/`, `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/candidates/round125-standard-option-en-disease-pilot/pilot/`
- Luna standard Pilot: `outputs/runs/rag/rag-sft-round126-standard-option-en-disease-luna-preflight/logs/preflight_report.json`, `outputs/experiments/rag_sft_iteration/candidates/round126-standard-option-en-disease-luna-pilot/pilot/`
- Current controls and active builders: `configs/experiments/data/data-rag-sft-iteration-control-v1.yaml`, `tools/rag_distill/run_pilot.py`, `tools/rag_distill/build_rag_expansion_plan.py`, `tools/rag_distill/catalog_and_isolation.py`

## Next safe action

Select a fresh Stage-A target for a new-ID Luna API3 strict preflight, then run one bounded standard Pilot only if it passes. Retain Round124/125 as negative evidence and release no adaptive sampling until a reviewed nonzero strict acceptance.
